### Generating OneToMany relationship

This package provides a simple short way to generate OneToMany relationship.

We could use our previous example Product entity.

So lets create a new entity called Command.

Before ending creation, click on OneToMany button, choose product table, choose associated field and click on OneToMany Button again to be confirmed.

Then click on migration button.
